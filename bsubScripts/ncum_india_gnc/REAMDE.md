This ncum_india_gnc will post process NCUM pp/ff files into grads-nc (i.e. grads will support) files.
I used wgrib2 -grads command and imd obs rainfall created via grads script itself.
So lower version of grads like 1.8 also supports this nc files.
Moreover for using ArcGIS software, we need to create nc files as grads supported.
