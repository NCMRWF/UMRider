What is mean by MFI ??

The IMD (Indian Meteorological Department) is in the middle of a massive integration exercise to get rid of its compartmentalised way of working and to adopt a more holistic and centralised model. The department has procured hardware systems that will facilitate this integration process. These systems will enable the department to get the weather data at the right time, with the required consistency and accuracy.

The Met Department has ordered a 'Synergy system' from Toulose-based French company MFI (Meteo France International). The system will integrate the working environments of regional Met centres at Mumbai, Nagpur, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkatta and Guwhati which also includes other sub offices. Currently these centres work on their own models to process the data compiled from radar pictures, surface charts, synoptic charts and various other sources of data. This data is then sent in the form of bulletins to end users like the aviation sector, high sea travellers, ports, ONGC etc.
